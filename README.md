🎯 Emotion Detection Using Offensive Memes
This project focuses on detecting and classifying offensive memes based on the emotions they evoke, using machine learning techniques. By analyzing meme filenames and associated metadata, the system automatically identifies emotional tones such as anger, humor, sarcasm, or hate. The goal is to support better content moderation and gain insights into the emotional impact of offensive media.

📝 Project Title and Description
Project Title: Emotion Detection Using Offensive Memes
Description: This is an AI-based system for categorizing memes into emotional categories by analyzing filenames and associated text data. The model uses TF-IDF vectorization and an SVM classifier to automate classification tasks and help organize meme datasets based on the emotions they express.
